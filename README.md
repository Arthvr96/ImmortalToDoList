## General

An immortal project that everyone has, including me.
It's not the most banal to-do-list but still enough banal<br>
Luckily it looks even worse than it works!<br>
<strong>Once you see her. Remember, I warned üí©</strong>.


## Guide

There are 2 routes. `To-Do-List` and `Form` for adding tasks. <br>
I know very complicated but I hope you can keep up.

### Features: 

<strong>Add task route</strong>
* In the form you can create tasks *(surprising)*. You can add title, description and choose complexity level.<br><br>
`‚òïÔ∏èTake a break here because the next route has much more functionality!`
<br>
<strong>To-do-list route</strong><br>

* View is split to 2 sections. Tasks to do and tasks complete.
* You can delete tasks or set competed. 
* If the description is too long it is cut off and a read more button appears `(WOW MAGIC)`
* You can sort task by time adding or complexity level. `(WOW BLACK MAGIC)`
